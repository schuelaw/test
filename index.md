## Git Hub Pages Demo ##

This is a demo of various elements of publishing content using [github
pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you create a folder in the `gh-pages` branch called `_includes`, you can
export plotly visualizations, copy the output to the `_includes` folder,
and include the visualizations using `{% include visname.html %}`. Like
this {% include ww-cases.html %}.
